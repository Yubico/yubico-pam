.SH NAME
ykpamcfg - Manage user settings for the Yubico PAM module.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ykpamcfg
[\fI-1\fR | \fI-2\fR] [\fI-A\fR] [\fI-p\fR] [\fI-v\fR] [\fI-h\fR]
.\".SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
.TP
\fB\-1\fR
use slot 1.  This is the default.
.TP
\fB\-2\fR
use slot 2.
.TP
\fB\-A \fIaction\fR
choose action to perform. See ACTIONS below.
.TP
\fB\-p \fIpath\fR
specify output file for, default is ~/.yubico/challenge
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
enable verbose mode.

.SH ACTIONS
.TP
\fBadd_hmac_chalresp\fR
The PAM module can utilize the HMAC-SHA1 Challenge-Response mode found in YubiKeys
starting with version 2.2 for \fBoffline authentication\fR.  This action creates the initial state
information with the C/R to be issued at the next logon.
.TP
\fBadd_saved_password\fR
The file is created containing challenge and secret string encrypted using the response.
If the PAM module is run with the argument \fBsupply_authtoken\fR, this string will be injected as PAM_AUTHTOKEN,
as if it was entered as password by the user.
Other PAM module can subsequently use it, for instance in order to unlock the keyring.

The utility currently outputs the state information to a file in the current user's
home directory (\fI~/.yubico/challenge-123456\fR for a YubiKey with serial number API readout
enabled, and \fI~/.yubico/challenge\fR for one without).

The PAM module supports a system wide directory for these state files (in case the user's
home directories are encrypted), but in a system wide directory, the 'challenge' part should
be replaced with the username. Example : \fI/var/yubico/challenges/alice-123456\fR.

To use the system-wide mode, you currently have to move the generated state files manually and
configure the PAM module accordingly.

.SH EXAMPLE
First, program a YubiKey for challenge response on Slot 2 :
.HP
.nf
$ \fBykpersonalize \-2 \-ochal-resp \-ochal-hmac \-ohmac-lt64 \-oserial-api-visible\fR
 ...
Commit? (y/n) [n]: y
$
.fi
.HP
Now, set the current user to require this YubiKey for logon :
.HP
.nf
$ \fBykpamcfg \-2 \-v\fR
 ...
Stored initial challenge and expected response in '/home/alice/.yubico/challenge-123456'.
$
.fi
.HP
Then, configure authentication with PAM for example like this (\fImake a backup first\fR) :
.HP
\fI/etc/pam.d/common-auth\fR (from Ubuntu 10.10) :

.nf
auth	required	pam_unix.so nullok_secure try_first_pass
auth	[success=1 new_authtok_reqd=ok ignore=ignore default=die]	pam_yubico.so mode=challenge-response
auth	requisite	pam_deny.so
auth	required	pam_permit.so
auth	optional	pam_ecryptfs.so unwrap
.fi

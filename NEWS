pam_yubico NEWS -- History of user-visible changes.             -*- outline -*-

* Version 2.13 (unreleased)

* Version 2.12 (released 2012-06-15)

** Only use libyubikey when --with-cr is used.

** Set correct permissions on tempfile.

** YubiKey 2.2 contains a bug in challenge-response that makes it output the
same response to all challenges unless HMAC_LT64 is set. Add warnings to
ykpamcfg and a warning through conversate in the pam module. Keys programmed
like this should be reprogrammed with the HMAC_LT64 flag set.

* Version 2.11 (released 2012-02-10)

** Fix crash-bug with challenge-response mode when button press is required,
but button is never pressed. Reported and fixed by
Lingzhu Xiang <xianglingzhu@gmail.com>.

** Fix a memset() with wrong size as reported by clang, as well as some
other problems/warnings when building on Mac OS X, thanks to
Clemens Lang <neverpanic@gmail.com>.

** Add prefix-matching of LDAP fetched values, so you can store the
token-to-user mapping in a multi-value attribute with values like
"yubikey:publicid", "other-token:something" etc. Patch by
Remi Mollon <remi.mollon@cern.ch>.

* Version 2.10 (released 2011-12-14)

** Drop permissions (to the user that is trying to authenticate) before
accessing files in the users home directory. Largely based on a patch by
Ricky Zhou <ricky@fedoraproject.org>. Thanks!
** Restore challenge-response support - version 2.7 was supposed to make
the dependency on libykpers optional, but in reality accidentally
disabled challenge-response for all configurations. As before, use
--without-cr to compile pam_yubico without the ykpers dependency.

* Version 2.9 (released 2011-11-17)

** Security: Explicitly request ykclient to verify server signature.
ykclient <= 2.5 strangely enough defaults to signing requests, but not
verifying signatures in responses when it is supplied with a client key.

Reported and patched by Dominic Rutherford <dominic@rutherfordfamily.co.uk>.

* Version 2.8 (released 2011-08-26)

** Fix big security hole: Authentication succeeded when no password
was given, unless use_first_pass was being used.
This is fatal if pam_yubico is considered 'sufficient' in the PAM
configuration.

Reported and patched by Nanakos Chrysostomos <nanakos@wired-net.gr>.

* Version 2.7 (released 2011-06-07)

** Make dependency on libykpers optional.
Use --without-cr to force it.  Reported by Jussi Sallinen <jussi@jus.si>.

* Version 2.6 (released 2011-04-11)

** This release includes lots of patches by members of our open
source community. Thank you all!

** Add Challenge-Response mode for offline validation (requires
YubiKey 2.2). Patch by Tollef Fog Heen.

** Eliminate all problems with pam_get_data by simply getting rid
of that code completely. This seems to have caused problems for a lot
of people.

** Numerous LDAP bug fixes and improvements, including community
patches by judas.iscariote and maxsanna81@gmail.com. Change to
LDAPv3, since v2 has been declared historic for a looong time.

** Support passing capath parameter to Yubico validation client.
Patch by Remi Mollon.

** Support public id's longer/shorter than 6 bytes. Patch by
fraser.scott@gmail.com.

** Convert documentation to Asciidoc format used in Github wiki.

** Try to never log passwords in debug logs.

* Version 2.5 (released 2010-09-10)

** Wiki articles are now inclded in the archive.  Same license as code.
Reported by dmitrij.ledkov in Issue #30:
<http://code.google.com/p/yubico-pam/issues/detail?id=30>.

* Version 2.4 (released 2010-09-10)

** New keyword "verbose_otp" to allow displaying OTP characters.
Contributed by qistoph reported in Issue #22:
<http://code.google.com/p/yubico-pam/issues/detail?id=22>.

** Build with -DPAM_DEBUG so that debug file writing works.
Reported by qistoph in Issue #20:
<http://code.google.com/p/yubico-pam/issues/detail?id=20>.

** Make deprecated "ldapserver" work again.
Reported by giovannibajo in Issue #27:
<http://code.google.com/p/yubico-pam/issues/detail?id=27>.

** Fix segmentation fault on 64-bit systems.
Reported by multiple people in Issue #11:
<http://code.google.com/p/yubico-pam/issues/detail?id=11>.

** Don't crash on ^D at su prompt, or generally, on a NULL password value.

* Version 2.3 (released 2010-04-14)

** New keyword "ldap_uri" added.
This keyword is preferred over the old "ldapserver" keyword, and
allows you to specify a complete LDAP URI instead of only the hostname
of your LDAP server.  Contributed by Zubrick.

** Improved README.
Contributed by Erinn Looney-Triggs <erinn.looneytriggs@gmail.com>.

* Version 2.2 (released 2009-05-11)

** Added new PAM configuration variable "key" for base64 client key.

* Version 2.1 (released 2009-03-31)

** Fix documentation.

** Fix warning.

* Version 2.0 (released 2009-03-25)

** Requires libykclient v2.0 or later.
See <http://code.google.com/p/yubico-c-client/>.

* Version 1.14 (released 2009-03-24)

** Quick release to sync release archive with svn code.

* Version 1.13 (released 2009-03-24)

** Fix parsing of password into OTP/ID/password.
Earlier string handling may have been incorrect for short strings.

** Don't pass integers via pam_set_data/pam_get_data.
May solve problems on 64-bit platforms.  Based on patch from
forum.yubico.com.

* Version 1.12 (released 2009-03-24)

** Add support for "use_first_pass" and "try_first_pass".
They work similar to other PAM modules, see README for more
documentation.

Upgrade notice: If you are relying on getting the Yubikey OTP from an
earlier PAM module, and no prompting by the pam_yubico module, you
need to add "try_first_pass" to preserve the same behaviour.

* Version 1.11 (released 2009-02-11)

** Added support to store user:keyid mapping in LDAP.
Contributed by Gregory Brusick <gregory@brusick.ch>.

* Version 1.10 (released 2009-01-13)

** Change license to 2-clause BSD.
The Linux-PAM license is unclear, and in any case, the 2-clause BSD
license is compatible with 3-clause BSD and GPL.

* Version 1.9 (released 2009-01-13)

** Solaris portability improvements.
Suggested by Martin Englund <Martin.Englund@Sun.COM>.

* Version 1.8 (released 2008-09-15)

** Add new parameter 'url' to specify the server template URL.

* Version 1.7 (released 2008-09-01)

** Support two-factor mode to provide a password.

** Support a user-specific configuration file to allow yubikeys per user.

** Use libyubikey-client instead of direct use of libcurl.

** First release from code.google.com repository.

** Clarify documentation with regard to license and development info.

* Version 1.5 (internal release)

** Clarify that license is the same as Linux-PAM (GPLv2 or modified BSD).
This is likely the last internal release, source moving to code.google.com.

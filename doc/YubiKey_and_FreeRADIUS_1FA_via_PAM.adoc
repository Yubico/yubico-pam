Yubico PAM Single-factor configuration guide
--------------------------------------------

Step by Step Guide for Configuration of Yubico PAM module to provide single
factor YubiKey OTP authentication for RADIUS server.

Introduction
------------
The purpose of this document is to guide readers through the configuration
steps to enable single factor authentication using YubiKey and RADIUS server
on Linux platform. This document assumes that the reader has advance knowledge
and experience in Linux system administration, particularly how to configure
PAM authentication mechanism on a Linux platform.


Details

Prerequisites
-------------

Successful configuration of the Yubico PAM module to support single factor
authentication for RADIUS requires following prerequisites:

* Operating System: Any Unix operating system which supports PAM
  (Pluggable Authentication Module)
  (http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/)
* Complier : GNU GCC complier (http://gcc.gnu.org/)
* FreeRADIUS: FreeRADIUS Version: 1.1.7 or *later*
  (http://freeradius.org/download.html)
* Yubico PAM Module: Yubico PAM Module Version 1.8
  (https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-pam/)


Configuration
-------------

Configuration of FreeRADIUS server to support PAM authentication :
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Edit the radiusd configuration file “/etc/raddb/radiusd.conf” to make
  following changes:
------
  * Change user and group to “root” to provide the root privileges to
    radiusd daemon so that it can call and use pam modules for authentication.
    NOTE: Generally, it is not a good security practice to assign root
    privileges to a user for a daemon. However, since use of PAM requires root
    privileges, this is a mandatory step here.
  * In “authenticate” section uncomment pam to direct radiusd daemon to use PAM
    module for authentication
------
* Edit the client configuration file “/etc/raddb/clients.conf”
------
   Add sample client for testing
------
* Edit the user configuration file “/etc/raddb/users” to make following change:
------
   Change "DEFAULT Auth-Type = System" to "DEFAULT Auth-Type = pam" for using
   PAM modules for user authentication
------

Installation of pam_yubico module :
-----------------------------------
Build instructions for pam_yubico are available in the README.
(https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-pam/wiki/ReadMe)

Configuration of pam_yubico module :
------------------------------------
Configuration instructions for pam_yubico are also available in the README.
(https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-pam/wiki/ReadMe)

_Make sure you set your system up for either central authorization mapping,
or user level mapping, as this will control which users can connect to the
system using RADIUS._

Configuration of modified pam_yubico.so module at administrative level :
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Append the following line to the beginning of /etc/pam.d/radiusd file:

------
   auth required pam_yubico.so id=16 debug authfile=/etc/yubikey_mappings
------

After the above configuration changes, whenever a user connects to the
server using any RADIUS client, the PAM authentication interface will pass
the control to Yubico PAM module.

The Yubico PAM module first checks the presence of authfile argument in PAM
configuration. If authfile argument is present, it parses the corresponding
mapping file and verifies the username with corresponding YubiKey PublicID
as configured in the mapping file.

If valid, the Yubico PAM module extracts the OTP string and sends it to the
Yubico authentication server or else it reports failure. If authfile argument
is present but the mapping file is not present at the provided path PAM
module reports failure. After successful verification of OTP Yubico PAM module
from the Yubico authentication server, a success code is returned.


User Level :
------------

Although, user level configuration of pam_yubico is possible, this might not
be a desired configuration option in case of radisud daemon in most enterprise.


Configuration of selinux policy to create exception for radiusd daemon :
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Local effective selinux policy must be updated to provide sufficient
privileges to radiusd daemon on system resources. Please follow the steps below
to configure effective selinux policy for radiusd daemon:

* Start the radiusd daemon
* Test the RADIUS authentication with the test case provided in “Testing the
  configuration” section below
* As radiusd daemon doesn’t have sufficient selinux privileges to access the
  system resources required for using pam modules, the RADIUS authentication
  will fail.
* This will create the logs in either “/var/log/messages” or in
  “/var/log/audit/audit.log” depending on the selinux configuration.
* We can use audit2allow utility to provide selinux privileges to radiusd by
  using following sequence of commands:

------
  [root@testsrv ~]# audit2allow -m local -l -i /var/log/messages > local.te

  [root@testsrv ~]# checkmodule -M -m -o local.mod local.te

  [root@testsrv ~]# semodule_package -o local.pp -m local.mod

  [root@testsrv ~]# semodule -i local.pp
------

Configuration of FreeRADIUS PAM file :
--------------------------------------

FreeRADIUS server first authorizes presence of user in the configured database
and then authenticates it.

In a single factor YubiKey authentication, we must provide a PAM mechanism to
authorize the presence of user.

We are using “pam_listfile.so” PAM module to provide a PAM mechanism to
authorize the presence of user. For this, we need to provide a file containing
authorized user names to the “pam_listfile.so” file. This file should contain
user names with only one user name on each line as follows:

For example:

------
   paul
------

The user_name file must be created/updated manually before configuration of
Yubico PAM module for RADIUS authentication. Once this file is ready, we need
to edit the FreeRADIUS PAM configuration file “/etc/pam.d/radiusd” and replace
its contents with following lines:

------
  auth    sufficient	pam_yubico.so id=16 debug authfile=/etc/yubikeyid
  account required	pam_listfile.so onerr=fail item=user sense=allow file=<Absolute path of file containing user names>
------


Test Setup :
------------

Our test environment is as follows:

* Operating System: Fedora release 8 (Werewolf)
* FreeRADIUS Server : FreeRADIUS Version 1.1.7 and Version 2.1.3
* Yubico PAM: pam_yubico  Version 1.8
* "/etc/pam.d/radiusd" file:

------
   auth    sufficient	pam_yubico.so id=16 debug authfile=/etc/yubikeyid
   account required	pam_listfile.so onerr=fail item=user sense=allow file=/etc/yubicousers
------

Testing the configuration :
---------------------------

We have tested the pam_yubico configuration on following Linux sever platforms:

* Fedora 8:
------
  * Operating system: Fedora release 8 (Werewolf)
  * FreeRADIUS Server : FreeRADIUS Version 1.1.7 and Version 2.1.3
  * Yubico PAM: pam_yubico  Version 1.8
------
* Fedora 6:
------
  * Operating system: Fedora Core release 6 (Zod)
  * FreeRADIUS Server : FreeRADIUS Version 1.1.7 and Version 2.1.3
  * Yubico PAM: pam_yubico  Version 1.8
------

To test the RADIUS single factor authentication with YubiKey, we can use
“radtest” radius client. The command is as follows:

------
  [root@testsrv ~]# radtest {username} \
  		    	    {password followed by YubiKey generated OTP} \
  			    {radius-server}:{radius server port} \
			    {nas-port-number} \
			    {secret/ppphint/nasname}

  [root@testsrv ~]# radtest test vrkvfefuitvfvgu...ildbdk 127.0.0.1 0 testing123
------


Note :
------
The FreeRADIUS server version 1.1.3 seems to have problems regarding memory
management and it may result in Segmentation Fault if configured with Yubico
PAM module. We recommend using FreeRADIUS server version 1.1.7 or above.

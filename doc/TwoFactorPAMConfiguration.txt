PAM configuration is somewhat complex, but a typical use-case is to
require both a password and Yubikey to allow access.  This can be
achieved by a PAM configuration like this:

```
   auth requisite pam_yubico.so id=42
   auth required pam_unix.so use_first_pass
```

The first line makes pam_yubico check the OTP.  Use either a per-user
file called ~/.yubico/authorized_yubikeys, or a system wide file called
/etc/yubikey_mappings to specify which Yubikeys that can be used to log
in as specific users. See the https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-pam/wiki/ReadMe for more details about this.

The "use_first_pass" on the next line says that the password the pam_unix
module should check should be received from the earlier PAM modules
and that the module should not query for passwords.

Of course, if you use username/password verification from a SQL
database or LDAP, you need to change the second line above.  But the
module you use needs to support "use_first_pass" for this to work.
Most modules support this.

Be sure to comment out any other 'auth' lines in your PAM configuration,
unless you want those.  For example, Debian contains a
'@include common-auth' which would confuse the configuration.

To log in, you now need to enter both your Unix password and enter an
OTP using your Yubikey. When prompted for the password, enter the Unix
password first and then (without pressing enter) push the button on your
Yubikey.

If it doesn't work, enable debugging (see https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-pam/wiki/ReadMe) and try again.
